# Python Data Analysis Training

This repository contains the material used for a three-session Python Data
Analysis training at Steer, originally delivered in April 2023.

Recordings are available
[here](https://steer.learnupon.com/enrollments/167923799/details) (enrollment
required).

This repository includes an interactive Jupyter notebook for each session,
containing example code and descriptive text. The notebooks also include
exercises for participants to complete on their own. For convenience, the
repository also includes (non-interactive) HTML and PDF versions of each
notebook, along with support files. Note that exercise code should be removed
before distributing to participants.

So that participants were not required to have Jupyter Notebook installed in
advance, we hosted a [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)
server on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance using
[The Littlest JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) to which
participants could directly connect. This allowed each participant to have a
unique copy of each notebook that they could modify and for common data files to
easily be shared across participants. For more details on this setup, please
contact [Andrew Desautels](mailto:andrew.desautels@steergroup.com).
